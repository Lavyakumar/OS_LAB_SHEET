# Lab Sheet 2 – System Startup, Process Creation, and Termination Simulation

## Course Information
**Course Code:** ENCS351  
**Course Name:** Operating System  
**Program:** B.Tech CSE 
**Author:** Lavya Kumar Beriwal

---

## 🧠 Objective
Simulate the startup, process creation, and shutdown sequence of an operating system using Python. The experiment demonstrates process lifecycle and logging mechanisms.

---

## 🧰 Tools Used
- Python 3.x  
- multiprocessing  
- logging  
- time  

---

## 🧪 How to Run

1. Open terminal and navigate to the folder:
   ```bash
   cd LAB_SHEET_2
2. Run the Python script:
    python3 system_startup_simulation.py
3. After execution, check the generated log file:
    cat process_log.txt
4. 📊 Expected Output
    Terminal:
        System Starting...
        System Shutdown.
        process_log.txt:
        2025-10-06 21:25:42,110 - MainProcess - System Booting...
        2025-10-06 21:25:42,111 - Process-1 - Process-1 started
        2025-10-06 21:25:42,112 - Process-2 - Process-2 started
        2025-10-06 21:25:44,115 - Process-1 - Process-1 ended
        2025-10-06 21:25:44,116 - Process-2 - Process-2 ended
